# Contributing to Streaming Ad Blocklist

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!  
This blocklist helps block ads on various streaming services. It is specifically optimized for **AdGuard Home**, but also works with other DNS-based blockers like **Pi-hole**.

Before contributing, please read the following guidelines to ensure that your contribution aligns well with the project.

## How to Contribute

### 1. **Report Issues**
   - If you encounter problems or find missing domains in the blocklist, you can open an **issue** on GitHub.
   - Describe the problem or missing domain in detail so we can address it effectively.

### 2. **Add New Domains**
   - If you discover new domains used by streaming platforms for ads or tracking, feel free to suggest or add them.
   - Make sure the domains are accurate and specific.
   - When adding multiple domains related to a platform (e.g., **YouTube**, **Netflix**, or **Pluto TV**), ensure they are ad- or tracking-related and do not interfere with the core functionality of the service.

### 3. **Pull Requests**
   - Fork the repository to create your own copy.
   - Create a new branch for your changes (e.g., `add-new-domains`).
   - Add the domains to the appropriate section (e.g., YouTube, Prime Video, Netflix).
   - Thoroughly test your changes to make sure they block ads effectively without breaking functionality.
   - Submit a pull request with a detailed description of your changes.

### 4. **Code Quality and Formatting**
   - Follow the existing format for entries (e.g., `0.0.0.0 <domain>`).
   - Remove unnecessary or commented-out lines (unless used for clear documentation purposes).

### 5. **Testing**
   - No formal testing framework is required at the moment.
   - However, it is strongly recommended to test the blocklist in your own setup before submitting a pull request.

## Contribution Etiquette

To maintain a friendly and respectful community, all contributors are expected to follow these principles:

- **Respect and Courtesy:** Treat others with respect. Keep all communication constructive and polite.
- **Constructive Feedback:** When suggesting changes, explain clearly and precisely why the change is needed and how it improves the project.
- **No Discrimination:** Discrimination, harassment, or toxic behavior will not be tolerated in this project.

## License

By submitting a pull request, you agree that your contribution will be licensed under the **MIT License**, as stated in the projectâ€™s [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.
