# Streaming Services Ads Blocklist for AdGuard Home

🎯 **Purpose of this list:** Block ads on streaming services, including short commercials that play before the actual content.

## 📌 Background

Many streaming platforms (such as Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, Netflix, PlutoTV, and others) occasionally display ads before or during content playback. This blocklist is designed to block such disruptive ads without interfering with the actual streaming experience.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This list only blocks ad and tracking domains associated with streaming services. It does **not** affect the streaming content itself.

## 🔧 Compatibility

This list is optimized for **AdGuard Home**, but it should also work with other DNS-based blockers such as **Pi-hole**. Behavior may vary depending on the DNS software being used.

**Supported systems:**
- AdGuard Home 🌐  
- Pi-hole (and similar DNS-based blockers) 🔒
